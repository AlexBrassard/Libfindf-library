fri 5/8/16:
Since early this morning I've been trying to compile the library with
GCC's -fsanitize=address and -fno-omit-frame-pointer arguments, and none
of the tests programs are working anymore.
Valgrind's telling me 'Shadow memory range interleaves with an existing
memory mapping. ASan cannot proceed correctly. ABORTING.' which makes me
think some of Libfindf's initialization routine (libfindf_init.c) may be
happening before libasan actualy sanitized the addresses or something of the likes.
Did not find all that many information on internet, most people said to simply
add LD_PRELOAD=libasan to the environment, which doest not work in my case
(ld complains it can't findf libasan.so).
I'll keep looking.
