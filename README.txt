The Libfindf library is a collection of functions to allow
a user to easely search one or more file(s) in mounted filesystem(s).

Three functions are readily available to use:

findf()        -       "Quick" filesystem search using the library's default parameters.

findf_fg()     -       Finer-grained search using user defined parameters.

(Optionaly)
findf_adv()    -       Finer-grained search using user defined parameters, as well as user defined
	       	       searching and sorting algorithms.

More information can be found on each routines (and more) within their respective man-pages,
made available in the "man_pages_src/" directory.
